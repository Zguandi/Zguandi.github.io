Satellites of galactic-mass systems show excessive coherent motions than predivted by cosmological models. Despite the excess being predicted by up-to-date cosmological sims, the excess signal is still $4.1\sim3.6\sigma$  in tension. This velocity correlation excess is independent from sample selection.

## Excess in Planar satellite galaxies

Observation of Andromeda & satellite galaxies shows that, if seen from Andromeda, satillites on its sky appear:

*Fig. 1.— An Aitoff-Hammer Projection showing the positions of M31’s satellites, along with their associated 1σ uncertainties. The positions show where each object would appear in the sky if viewed from the centre of M31, and are given in M31’s inherent galactic latitude and longitude. The position of the Milky Way is also shown for reference. The position uncertainties trace single arcs across the M31 sky, rather than two-dimensional patches on account of the restriction of the uncertainty to lie solely along the line of sight to the object from Earth. For this same reason, all the lines point radially outward from the Milky Way. These uncertainties also take into account the uncertainty in M31’s distance. The existence of a prominent plane, broadly consisting of Andromedas I, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XVI, XVII, XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXX and NGC147 and NGC185, is hinted at by the close proximity of their respective arcs.*

By a best fit, the satellites are arranged on a planar structure significantly. Furthermore, investigation shows that there exist a planar subset of satellites consisting of roughly half of the satellites. Seen from the diagram above, satellite Andromedas I, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XVI, XVII, XXV, XXVI, XXVII and XXX and dwarf ellipticals NGC147 and NGC185 all appeared to lie along the plane. This is significantly different from a random distribution of satellite galaxies.

This phenomenon is occurent not only at Andromeda, but also at [Centaurus A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08138) and our [Milky way galaxy](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/174/3/695/971557?login=false). 

But wait, why do we expect the satellite galaxies to be distributed as isotropic?
